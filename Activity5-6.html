	<ol><!-- the ordered list -->
		<li>just like us, PDls do their basic human rights, so do not judge them.</li>
		<li>if you happen to know a PDL, do not make fun of them nor say hurtful words</li>
		<li>If you happen to know someone who is related to a PDL, Do not tag them them as to someone similar to their convicted relative that might also do the same acts</li>
		<li>Highly encourage everyone to use this term instead to use the previous term to end the stigma of placing negative connotation towards them.</li>
