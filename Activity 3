Oh, yeah

Open up your heart to me<br />
And say what's on your mind, oh yes<br />
I know that we have been through so much pain<br />
But I still need you in my life, this time<br /><br />


And I need you tonight<br />
I need you right now<br />
I know deep within my heart<br />
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right<br />
I really need you tonight<br /><br />


I figured out what to say to you<br />
Sometimes the words they, they come out so wrong<br />
(Always they do)<br />
And I know in time that you will understand<br />
That what we have is so right, this time<br /><br />


And I need you tonight<br />
I need you right now<br />
I know deep within my heart<br />
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right<br /><br />


All those endless times<br />
We tried to make it last forever more<br />
And baby I know<br />
I need you (oh oh, yeah)<br />
I know deep within my heart<br />
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right<br />
I really need you, oh<br /><br />


I need you tonight (I need you, oh I need you baby)<br />
I need you right now (It's got to be this, it's got to be this)<br />
I know deep within my heart<br />
No, it doesn't matter if it's wrong or it's right<br />
All I know is baby<br />
I really need you tonight<br />
Ooh<br /><br />
